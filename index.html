        <h2>Education History</h2>
        <p>I am currently a student of software development in ASAC. I graduated last year with a physics degree.</p>

        <h2>Job Experience</h2>
        <p>I have officially worked once, for 4 months. I have worked as a science teacher last semester, but I realized that I will not feel satisfied with my accomplishments in this field, so I thought about doing something in programming, and here I am.</p>
        
        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>In fact, physics is my passion. To be an active physicist in industry and cutting-edge industry, one must have many skills. One of these skills could be software development. This is why I am enjoying software development and willing to explore it in every way I can, and hoping to be someone who helps people lives to be better.</p>
